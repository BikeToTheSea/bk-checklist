# Bike Kitchen Checklist
Checklist for bike inspections at the [Bike Kitchen](https://biketothesea.org/bk/).

## To Do
* Create a diagnosis/prescription sheet
* Explore visual guides for following the checklist

## Checklist Goals
We follow the [ABC's of bike checks](https://bikeleague.org/videos/basic-bike-check/).
More sophisticated workflows can be incorporated later, but these are key items
to check to ensure that possible systematic issues can be resolved before a BK
client leaves, or issues requiring the skills of a more experienced BK volunteer
are appropriate rerouted to them during each bike check.

## Checklist Items

* Put bike on bike stand
    * Default to drive chain side facing towards you (or "out" from the bike stand)
    * Unless you know the other side is needed
* Preference for clamp locations:
    * Seat post
    * Vertical side of forward triangle
    * Bottom of top edge of forward triangle
* Be careful with carbon-fiber or aluminum frames/seat posts
    * Metal alloys will have weld joints along joining edges on frame
* [ ] Air
    * [ ] Is there enough air in the tires?
        * Use a floor pump with a pressure meter for accuracy and precision.  Find the recommended tire pressure number/range on the tire sidewall.
    * [ ] What tire valves are on the bike?
        * The most common valve types on bikes sold in the U.S.A. are [Schrader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrader_valve) and [Presta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presta_valve).
    * [ ] Do the tires have dry rot?
        * Early signs of dry rot are micro cracks appearing when pinching the tire.  Late signs of dry rot is visible thread lines anywhere, including the sidewalls.
    * [ ] Is the bead of the tires seated correctly?
    * [ ] For directional tread patterns: is the pattern facing forward?
* [ ] Brakes
    * [ ] Do the brakes work?
    * [ ] Do the brakes need adjustment?
    * [ ] What is the type and style of brakes?
* [ ] Chain
    * [ ] Can the chain move?  Are there stuck links?  You might only be able to tell after pedaling.
    * [ ] Using the chain checker tool, is there too much stretch in the chain?
        * Relevant for bikes with shifters for multiple speeds
        * Single-speed bikes don't have this issue, as a maintainer can simply apply more tension to chain tensioners.
* [ ] Seat
    * [ ] Is seat height at comfortable height?
    * If possible, determine the style of riding used on the bike in question.
    * Riding styles in more urban environments, where stopping quickly is prioritized, and you are not going very far distances (below 10-20 miles for each trip); then the seat height may slightly lower than hip height for increased comfort.
    * Riding styles that are closer to long-distance riding (such as riding distances 50 miles or more in a single trip, closer to [century rides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_ride)) should follow the standard rule of thumb: your seat height should be at hip height and you should be on your tip toes when stopping and leaning to one side.
        * You should probably pay for a professional bike fitting if you are training for a century ride.
* [ ] Other factors of comfort
* The following tend to be issues found on cheaper bikes bought from large retail stores that don't specialize in bikes (such as Walmart, Target, and so on)
    * [ ] Are brake levers angled correctly?
        * [ ] Depends on each bike, but generally should point downard and below the horizon, not upward and pointing above the horizon.
    * [ ] Are reflectors attached correctly?
    * [ ] Are other convenience accessories, such as baskets, attached correctly and safely?

### Final send-off
The BK volunteer should ride the bike to ensure the bike is safe to ride, before
returning the bike to the client.
